		<p>MemberMouse provides you with a wide range of SmartTags you can use to create a dynamic experience for your members. 
		There are SmartTags that display the current member's name, email address and other information, ones you can use to allow member's 
		to manage their subscriptions, ones you can use to change content based on the current member's access rights and a lot more.</p>

		<p>This is all very helpful when you're working within WordPress' content authoring environment, but what if you 
		want to be able to do all of this within a custom PHP script?</p>

		<p>This is where the PHP Interface comes in.</p>
